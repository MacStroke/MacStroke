###Configurable global mouse gesture for macOS.
>MacStroke is a gesture-recognition application for MacOS. Gestures or strokes are movements that you make with you mouse (or your pen, finger etc.) while holding down a specific mouse button. MacStroke will execute certain actions if it recognizes the stroke; currently MacStroke can emulate key presses, execute shell commands, hold down modifiers and emulate a scroll wheel. The program was designed with Tablet PCs in mind and can be used effectively even without access to a keyboard. MacStroke tries to provide an intuitive and efficient user interface, while at the same time being highly configurable and offering many advanced features.<p>
